# Pizza Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL and Power BI to uncover trends, customer preferences, and overall sales performance. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights that drive business decisions, optimize menu offerings, and improve profitability.

## Key Components of the Analysis

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Sales Revenue**: Total income generated from pizza orders.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Average amount spent per transaction.
- **Order Frequency**: Number of orders placed within defined timeframes.

### 2. Sales Trends and Time Analysis
- Daily and monthly sales trends to detect seasonality and peak periods.
- Sales heatmaps by time of day for better staffing and operational planning.

### 3. Category and Size Breakdown
- Sales segmented by pizza category (e.g., Vegetarian, Meat Lovers).
- Comparison by pizza size: Small, Medium, and Large.

### 4. Best and Worst Performing Products
- Top-selling pizzas based on revenue and volume.
- Underperforming pizzas identified for potential menu optimization.

## Findings and Insights

- Sales consistently peak during weekends and holidays.
- Large-sized Meat Lovers pizzas dominate customer preference.
- Low-performing items may benefit from rebranding, bundling, or removal.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Data extraction, transformation, and querying.
- **Power BI**: Visual dashboards and trend analysis.
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and pre-processing.

## Project Files

- `pizza_sales.sql`: SQL queries used for data cleaning and KPI extraction.
- `pizza_sales_dashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard file.
- `cleaned_dataset.csv`: Pre-processed dataset used in Power BI.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Use

1. Load the dataset into a database or Power BI.
2. Run SQL scripts to transform and clean the data.
3. Open the Power BI file to explore interactive dashboards.
4. Apply insights for business decisions in marketing, operations, and pricing.

## Business Questions Addressed

- When are sales highest, and how can promotions align with that?
- What types and sizes of pizzas are most profitable?
- What opportunities exist to optimize the current menu?

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate machine learning models for sales forecasting.
- Perform customer segmentation for targeted marketing.
